Q1:Create a VPC 192.168.0.0/16 and using this VPC create subnet 192.168.0.0./16 and attach 
to EC2 instace.Start the EC2 instance and install tomcat inside it. create your own webpage
(Message:name and pnr) and host it with the help of tomcat server using default port 8080?

Ans: create vpc then create one subnet one gatway then this vpc create ec2 instance and
	launch tomcat server.

Q2:create policy for security department ,create policy for ec2 instance exept delete.attach this policy
to one IAM user(RAJ) then login as a RAj then create ec2 instance,install tomcat server and host webside.
create policy with read for ec2 instance and attach this policy to second iam user (rahul) and try 
to delete instance.

Q3:create publically hosted webside on s3 bucket(RAJ) can also have read/write and execute. then rahul try 
to delete it. 

Q4:Create EC2 instance of windows server access windows machine using rdp inside that machine install
tomcat server, A:Deploy war file in tomcat server.
	        B:Create your own server with name and prn.

Q5:heroku cloud(paas)Search 


Install Windows Instance:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*launch instance of windows machine.
*Go to the RDP client.
*Download remote desktop file.
*Generate password.(upload key pair then dicrypt)
*open remote desktop file and connect.
*Use google.com to install--> java X64 installer.
*Download tomcat software.
*Now, Host tomcat server-->http://localhost:8080
*Next--> A:upload war file in upload war file to deploy, and host-->http://localhost:8080/war_file_name.war
*Next-->B:C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\webapps\create a directory
		*inside this directory-->make html file (.html)
		*To host-->http://localhost:8080/directory_name/file_name.html




Confidenciality:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*First create a public-private key pair in the EC2 instance:
(keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA)

where keytool cmd is a java base cmd which user for allow public key and private key.

[In my case -->Enter keystore password is : z00heyz00 ]
[Enter key password for <tomcat> is : changeit]

*Digital certificate: That contait a name of the owner and the owners public key.
[The purpose of the digital certificate is to prove that the the public key belongs to the owner and no one else]

*WE export our public key and other information in a file .we will
then import this file into our web browsers certificate store
(keytool -exportcert -file couldcert.p12 -alias tomcat)

*We need to attach the certificate in our base machine(for browser),because this certificate is our generated not certified by
any organization.
 
*Copy file ec2 instance to base machine...
	--> protocal -- SCP
	-->install a tool WinSCP- allow us to download/upload files between local machine and EC2 instance.
	-->We need to provide EC2 instance Public ipv4 DNS(e.g.-->ec2-65-0-135-236.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
	   for our EC2 instance in this tool
	-->User id:ec2-user ,No password
	-->Advanced--provide the private key of the file for authentification and connect.
	-->Then it shows our decktop and EC2 instance file side-by-side.
	-->simply, Drag and Drop files.

	For non-windows user: (scp command)
	-->https://linuxhint.com/transfer-files-ec2-instance/
	For timeout try this:
	-->https://superuser.com/questions/577911/scp-lost-connection-but-ssh-works-fine/

file(cert)is successfully copy in our base machine.

*Then, Go to the browser then security --manage device certificate--trusted root authorities-inport security file.
